### CPSC 120

    Lab 12 and Lab 5, Lab 12 had to be my favorite as it was our
    primary introdution to RGB which i had fun in leraning how
    How coding to make colors from the colored spectrum go
    hand in hand. Lab 5 also being a close second mainly due
    to fact that all three parts worked to be able to
    make a satisfing 3rd part of calucting a hand in the
    game black jack score it followed a fun pattern of
    sequnces of coding like guessing game formats
